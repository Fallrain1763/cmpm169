			<h1>Experiment 5: 3D Graphics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I searched for two projects when I brainstormed this assignment. One was created by importing a video and displaying each frame of the image from left to right, another one posed a set of images as specific text by way of a two-dimensional array. Then, My idea was to form a box of each frame into a very three-dimensional text. So I looked up the project and learned how to use the translate() and box() functions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> In the last Experiment I used a 2D array to store the positions and generated my name using each frame of the video.Now I switch to WEBGL mode for p5.js and put box() cubes at each position and paste the image on it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>fter adjusting the position of the lens using the camera() function,  I used one of my boss fight videos in my favorite game, Hollow Knight, to create my 3D nickname.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Completing this assignment gave me a better understanding of the WEBGL and lost of functions such as camera(), translate(), box() etc. of p5js.This experience was more than just coding, but I also greatly enriched my artistic creativity by touring tons of other p5js creations while brainstorming ideas.</p>
