			<h1>Experiment 4: Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I searched for two projects when I brainstormed this assignment. One was created by importing a video and displaying each frame of the image from left to right, another one posed a set of images as specific text by way of a two-dimensional array. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p> I wanted to combine the two projects above to achieve the effect I wanted, i.e. to have each frame of a video gradually appear on the canvas and finally form a specific text.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I reconstructed the two-dimensional array into the text I wanted, my name, "SHUCHEN LIU.", and I used one of my boss fight videos in my favorite game Hollow Knight to create my name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Completing this assignment gave me a better understanding of the image() of p5js.This experience was more than just coding, but I also greatly enriched my artistic creativity by touring tons of other p5js creations while brainstorming ideas.</p>
