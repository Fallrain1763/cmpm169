			<h1>Experiment 2: Vector Art & Animation</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I start with the brainstorm the idea by browsing the Generative Design Website, and first thing I do is split the  background into three areas. I also found a color comparison example</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I finished the dynamic cursor with the color comparison technique. It will change depending on which color background the cursor is on</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I made the shape bordless and switch the "R", "G", "B" to Chinese characters. I also made the font color in the corresponding color area to the complementary color of its color.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I finished this experiment by myself. I think what I made is very simple, but it is interesting.</p>
