				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I used ChatGPT to brainstorm the idea for this experiment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>The first thing that comes to mind is changing the size of the font.Another effect I came up with was to add an animation effect to the text, where I made the text float up and down.Lastly, to increase the number of words, I chose a very classic nine-word mantra from Chinese Taoism: "临兵斗者皆阵列前行"
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>And then later on in terms of innovation I'm thinking of adding some clickable interactions. I'm going to set the initial canvas to blank, and when the player clicks on the canvas it randomly displays one of the characters from a nine-letter spell on the screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Completing this assignment gave me a better understanding of the Text-related functions in p5js.This experience was more than just coding, but I also greatly enriched my artistic creativity by touring tons of other p5js creations while brainstorming ideas.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
