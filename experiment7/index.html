			<h1>Experiment 7: Data Visualization & Networks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I used ChatGPT to brainstorm the idea for this experiment. Eventually I decided to plot the data as a visual bar graph.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I was thinking was to convert a .csv file to a 2D array and then plot a dynamic bar graph.The data I want to use for this data visualization is experimental data I collected from my lab in my physics class in community college.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I ended up placing the headers for the experimental data above the bars for each corresponding data and put a unique color for each header.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The presentation of each experimental data and the changes are very clear. Through the visualization I can very intuitively understand the relationship between the changes in the data. If I had been able to create this visualization of the bar graphs at the time, it would have helped me understand this physics experiment even more.</p>
