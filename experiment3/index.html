			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I found an example online which is the colorful and dreamlike work of art I want to approach. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>To make the artwork look more impactful as well as brighter, I adjusted the circle size using the noise function, and also used random to generate more impactful colors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, to make the image more colorful, I used a for loop to increase the number of circles by many.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Completing this assignment gave me a better understanding of the random() as well as noise() functions of p5js.This experience was more than just coding, but I also greatly enriched my artistic creativity by touring tons of other p5js creations while brainstorming ideas.</p>
